# Scripts used for custom H -> W + Ds sample production

### Environment
This repository is supposed to be located inside the `Configuration/GenProduction` package of a `CMSSW` version.
When I wrote and used these scripts, I used `CMSSW_10_2_25`, but that is outdated and should be replaced by a more recent version (e.g. `CMSSW_10_6_X` for Run-II UL).
This might also require some updates to the `cmsDriver` commands archived in this repository.

### Status
This repository is provided mainly as inspiration.
It is not really complete, nor streamlined, nor flexible.
It worked well enough for me as far as I went with this project.
But it's mainly the generator fragments (in the `python` folder) that could be copied and integrated into an already existing (and better) sample production workflow of your choice, if you have one.
