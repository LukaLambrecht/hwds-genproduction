Yet another processing chain...
From GEN level to MINIAODSIM level.
Goal: be able to use exactly the same file used for GEN-level studies 
      also for MINIAODSIM/ntuple-level studies and compare the output.

TO DO: up to now only copied some things here from gridpack_to_miniaod,
       need to make all necessary changes!
